#Hashmap

1- set(key, value) takes two arguments: the first is a key, and the second is a value. Assigns value to hashmap

2- get(key) takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If a key is not found, return null, else return value in that key

3- has(key) takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.

4- remove(key) takes a key as an argument. If the given key is in the hash map, it removes the entry with that key and returns true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it returns false.

5- length() returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.

6- clear() removes all entries in the hash map.

7- keys() returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.

8- values() returns an array containing all the values.

9- entries() returns an array that contains each key, value pair. Example: [[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]]
